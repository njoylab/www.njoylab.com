### How It Works (Simple Overview)

The main endpoint accepts a URL and returns structured JSON metadata.

Hereâ€™s a basic cURL example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-rapidapi-host.com/scrape" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Host: your-assigned-host" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Key: your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }'
```

Using Node.js:

```js
import axios from 'axios';

const response = await axios.post('https://your-rapidapi-host.com/scrape', {
  url: 'https://example.com'
}, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-RapidAPI-Host': 'your-assigned-host',
    'X-RapidAPI-Key': 'your-api-key'
  }
});

console.log(response.data);
```

Using Python:

```python
import requests

url = "https://your-rapidapi-host.com/scrape"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-RapidAPI-Host": "your-assigned-host",
    "X-RapidAPI-Key": "your-api-key"
}
data = {"url": "https://example.com"}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```
